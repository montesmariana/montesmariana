ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mariana Montes, Dr. in Linguistics with a growing passion for programming. I'm currently working in a Research Data Management Team, helping researchers manage their data ;)

I irregularly keep [a blog](https://www.marianamontes.me) where I publish posts on these topics now and then: creating R projects, using R Markdown... GitHub has become a great source to keep my work together. These are the highlights:

## PhD

- [My PhD thesis](https://cloudspotting.marianamontes.me), written with bookdown
- [The visualization tool](https://qlvl.github.io/NephoVis/) that was the backbone of my PhD research
- A [python module](https://montesmariana.github.io/semasioFlow) and an [R package](https://montesmariana.github.io/semcloud) gathering the functions I used in my research

## Other work

- The [R package **glossr**](https://montesmariana.github.io/glossr) to print linguistic glosses in R Markdown and Quarto (one input, several outputs) from dataframes.
- The [Electron application **concAnnotator**](https://github.com/montesmariana/concAnnotator) to facilitate manual annotation of concordances.
- Slides presented at conferences, such as [one in Spain](https://slides.marianamontes.me/aelco) or [my thesis defense](https://slides.marianamontes.me/cloudspotting)
