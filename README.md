ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mariana Montes, Dr. in Linguistics with a growing passion for programming.

I'm interested in enhancing the experience of research with R: running reproducible analyses, writing code that others can read, visualizing data in an honest and clear way, and keeping data, code and product linked. In particular, I want to help people in the Humanities (especially, but not exclusively, linguists), since in such areas our formal education in programming is rather lacking. I also have some Python and Javascript experience :)

I keep [a blog](https://www.marianamontes.me) where I publish posts on these topics now and then: creating R projects, using R Markdown... GitHub has become a great source to keep my work together. These are the highlights:

## PhD

- [My PhD thesis](https://cloudspotting.marianamontes.me), written with bookdown
- [The visualization tool](https://qlvl.github.io/NephoVis/) that was the backbone of my PhD research
- A [python module](https://montesmariana.github.io/semasioFlow) and an [R package](https://montesmariana.github.io/semcloud) gathering the functions I used in my research

## Other work

- The [R package **glossr**](https://montesmariana.github.io/glossr) to print linguistic glosses in R Markdown and Quarto (one input, several outputs) from dataframes.
- The [Electron application **concAnnotator**](https://github.com/montesmariana/concAnnotator) to facilitate manual annotation of concordances.
- Slides presented at conferences, such as [one in Spain](https://slides.marianamontes.me/aelco) or [my thesis defense](https://slides.marianamontes.me/cloudspotting)
